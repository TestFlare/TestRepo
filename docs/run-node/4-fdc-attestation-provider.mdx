:::info

The FDC Client deployment is now part of the [`flare-systems-deployment`](https://github.com/flare-foundation/flare-systems-deployment) repository, which is also used for deploying FTSOv2. Previously, this was managed under the `ftso-v2-provider-deployment` repository.

The older repository is being deprecated. While it can still be used for legacy deployments on Flare or Songbird, it is strongly recommended to transition to the newer version. Active development has shifted to the updated repository, where all new features and updates will be introduced. You can find the deprecation notice and detailed upgrade instructions [here](https://github.com/flare-foundation/ftso-v2-provider-deployment/tree/0.3.1-deprecation.2) until the information is merged into the official repository.

In addition to running the FDC Client, you must also deploy verifiers and nodes that the client depends on. The [`fdc-suite-deployment`](https://github.com/flare-foundation/fdc-suite-deployment) repository provides comprehensive instructions for setting up and deploying verifiers and nodes.

If you already operate some of the required nodes, you can connect the FDC Client to those existing nodes. However, ensure that the configurations are compatible to avoid any issues.
