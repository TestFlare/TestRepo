The FAssets system is currently in the open-beta period on the Coston test network.
To ensure a seamless experience for open-beta participants, the FAssets codebase was updated based on the results of the closed-beta period.

The open-beta period currently supports minting and redeeming XRP and BTC assets.

- Test the FAssets system in a live environment
- Gather feedback from users to improve the FAssets functionality and documentation
- Continue the education of the various roles supporting FAssets, such as [agents](/fassets/overview#agents), [liquidators](/fassets/overview#liquidators), and [challengers](/fassets/overview#challengers), so that they can get practical experience and prepare themselves for the general launch of the FAssets system
- Identify and resolve any remaining inconsistencies to ensure the system is as robust as possible before adding real user funds

## Phases

- **Phase One**: Agents will be onboarded and can interact with the FAssets system only via the command-line interface.
- **Phase Two**: A graphical user interface will be released for everyone to use instead of the command line.

After the Coston open beta ends, FAssets will launch on the Songbird network.
